# VPS Backup and Restore Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides commands and steps to back up and restore essential directories on your VPS. It also covers restoring user permissions and sudo configurations. Additionally, it includes instructions for verifying the integrity of your backups.

## Backup Commands

### Backup Important Directories

Use the following commands to back up the `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`, `/opt`, `/srv`, and `/root` directories from your VPS to your local machine.

1. **Backup the `/home` Directory**:

   ```bash
   scp -i C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\ssh_key\id_rsa -r ubuntu@91.214.190.5:/home C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\vps\vps_1_backup
   ```

2. **Backup the `/etc` Directory**:

   ```bash
   scp -i C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\ssh_key\id_rsa -r ubuntu@91.214.190.5:/etc C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\vps\vps_1_backup
   ```

3. **Backup the `/var` Directory**:

   ```bash
   scp -i C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\ssh_key\id_rsa -r ubuntu@91.214.190.5:/var C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\vps\vps_1_backup
   ```

4. **Backup the `/usr` Directory**:

   ```bash
   scp -i C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\ssh_key\id_rsa -r ubuntu@91.214.190.5:/usr C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\vps\vps_1_backup
   ```

5. **Backup the `/opt` Directory**:

   ```bash
   scp -i C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\ssh_key\id_rsa -r ubuntu@91.214.190.5:/opt C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\vps\vps_1_backup
   ```

6. **Backup the `/srv` Directory**:

   ```bash
   scp -i C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\ssh_key\id_rsa -r ubuntu@91.214.190.5:/srv C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\vps\vps_1_backup
   ```

7. **Backup the `/root` Directory**:

   ```bash
   scp -i C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\ssh_key\id_rsa -r ubuntu@91.214.190.5:/root C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\vps\vps_1_backup
   ```

### Using `rsync` for Backup

You can also use `rsync` to perform backups more efficiently. The following command backs up the specified directories using `rsync`:

```bash
rsync -avz -e "ssh -i C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\ssh_key\id_rsa" ubuntu@91.214.190.5:/home C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\vps\vps_1_backup
```

Repeat the command for other directories by changing the source path.

## Verify Backup Integrity

### Using Checksums

To verify the integrity of your copied files, you can generate and compare checksums.

1. **Generate Checksums in the Original Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/original_directory
   find . -type f -exec md5sum {{}} + > checksums.txt
   ```

2. **Copy the Checksums File**:

   ```bash
   scp -i C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\ssh_key\id_rsa checksums.txt ubuntu@91.214.190.5:/path/to/destination_directory
   ```

3. **Verify Checksums in the Copied Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/destination_directory
   md5sum -c checksums.txt
   ```

### Using `rsync` for Verification

If you used `rsync`, you can verify the integrity of the copied files by running:

```bash
rsync -avc --dry-run /path/to/original_directory/ /path/to/destination_directory/
```

## Restore Commands

After resetting your VPS, use the following commands to restore your files and directories:

1. **Restore the `/home` Directory**:

   ```bash
   scp -i C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\ssh_key\id_rsa -r C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\vps\vps_1_backup\home ubuntu@91.214.190.5:/home
   ```

2. **Restore the `/etc` Directory**:

   ```bash
   scp -i C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\ssh_key\id_rsa -r C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\vps\vps_1_backup\etc ubuntu@91.214.190.5:/etc
   ```

3. **Restore the `/var` Directory**:

   ```bash
   scp -i C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\ssh_key\id_rsa -r C:\Users\violatto_a\Desktop\Alex\vps\vps_1_backup\var ubuntu@91.214.190.5:/var
   ```

## Restore User Permissions

1. **Restore Ownership in `/home`**:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R user:group /home/user
   ```

   Replace `user` with the username and `group` with the appropriate group.

2. **Restore Sudo Permissions**:

   To restore sudo permissions, copy the backup of your `/etc/sudoers` file back to the original location:

   ```bash
   sudo cp /path/to/backup/sudoers /etc/sudoers
   ```

   Make sure to set the correct permissions:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers
   ```

## Restore Databases

If you have backed up databases, use the following commands to restore them:

- **For MySQL**:

   ```bash
   mysql -u username -p database_name < /path/to/backup/dump.sql
   ```

- **For PostgreSQL**:

   ```bash
   psql -U username -d database_name -f /path/to/backup/dump.sql
   ```

## Installing `rsync`

### On Linux

You can install `rsync` using the package manager of your Linux distribution. For example:

- **Debian/Ubuntu**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install rsync
   ```

- **CentOS/RHEL**:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install rsync
   ```

### On Windows

To use `rsync` on Windows, you can install it via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or use a package manager like `Cygwin` or `Git Bash`. Hereâ€™s how to do it with WSL:

1. **Install WSL** (if not already installed):

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

2. **Install a Linux Distribution** from the Microsoft Store (like Ubuntu).

3. **Open the WSL terminal** and install `rsync` as you would on a regular Linux machine:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install rsync
   ```

## Conclusion

Following this guide will help you back up and restore your VPS effectively. Always verify the integrity of your backups and ensure permissions are correctly set after restoration.
